-- FACTORING (LARGE PRIMES)

-- The algorithm is as follows:

-- 1. Find some numbers b s.t b*b mod n is small (or sometimes small and negative)
-- (Fermat's method would be to try numbers around intSqrt (k*n) for small k)
-- The continued fraction method uses the fact that continued fractions can provide good rational approximations to sqrt (k*n)

-- 2. For each b we have found, reduce b*b mod n to a factor base of small primes
-- (eg b1 -> p1^2*p2, b2 -> p3*p4^2, b3 -> p2*p3 etc)

-- (now we regard these reductions as vectors over F2, eg p2^2*p3 = (0,2,1,0,0,...) )
-- 3. Perform gaussian elimination on the vectors over the factor base, until we have a product of even powers of small primes
-- (eg b1*b2*b3 -> p1^2 * p2^2 * p3^2 * p4^2)

-- 4. Then we have x, a product of bis, and y, a product of pis, s.t x^2 = y^2 (mod n) - we are hoping, x /= +/- y (mod n)
-- (for example, we have (b1*b2*b3)^2 = (p1*p2*p3*p4)^2 )
-- Then we have x^2 - y^2 = 0 (mod n), so (x+y)(x-y) = kn.
-- What we're hoping is that either gcd (x+y,n) or gcd (x-y,n) will give us a factor
-- (It's not guaranteed, as we may find x+y = n, x-y = k, for example)



-- CONTINUED FRACTION CANDIDATES
-- We use the continued fraction expansion of sqrt kn to find numbers x s.t. x^2 `mod` n is small ( o(sqrt n) )

-- returns the least absolute residue, ie using a small negative number rather than a large positive number where possible
lmod x n = let x' = x `mod` n in if x' + x' < n then x' else x' - n

cfracCandidates k n = [(b `mod` n, (b*b) `lmod` n) | (_,(b,c)) <- convergentsForSqrt (k*n)]
-- b/c is an approximation to sqrt kn
-- hence we expect b*b - k*n*c*c == b*b `lmod` n to be small
