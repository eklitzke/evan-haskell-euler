-- OPTIMISED VERSION USING PARALLEL GCD
-- from Cohen
-- (Not fully implemented)

-- There is a possible optimisation where we can do several curves in parallel
-- (The point being that extendedEuclid is slow compared to multiplication mod n, and we can bundle up several extendedEuclids together at the expense of a few multiplications)
-- Not clear this would be a huge gain for smallish numbers
-- For n having 10 - 15 digits, we tend to need only 1 or a few curves
-- However, for n having 25 - 30 digits, we tend to need about a hundred curves
-- Even if we need only 1 curve, it might be that working in parallel will find our divisor sooner on one of the curves

-- alternatively we could just remove some of the (`mod` n)s from recipModParallel, and handle them later on in the code.
-- (but might not be a good idea as means our integer arithmetic is correspondingly slower)
